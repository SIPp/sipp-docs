    <title>IMS Bench SIPp</title> 
  </header>
  <body> 
      <p>This section is about a set of changes and additions to SIPp, contributed by Intel and
      aimed at providing an open source implementation of the <b>IMS/NGN Performance Benchmark</b>,
      ETSI specification TS 186 008.</p>

            <!-- li><link href="faq.html">FAQ</link></li -->
        </ul>

      <p>To learn more about what it is and what it can do, please read the
      <link href="intro.html">Introduction</link>. To get a really quick feel for it,
      here are a couple of example benchmark reports for hypothetical systems:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="images/report_ims.mht">Example Report with a hypothetical IMS Core as SUT</a></li>
       <li><a href="images/report_proxy.mht">Example Report with a hypothetical SIP proxy as SUT </a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>To learn how to use IMS Bench SIPp and how to create scenarios that take advantage of
      the features it brings, please refer to the <link href="reference.html">Reference documentation</link>.</p>

      <p><b>New features and Fixes in SVN revision 591 (15-Oct-2010):</b></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Support for automatic re-registration of the users. The users can now be re-registerd for instance after 1/2 hour, using new &lt;start_scen&gt; action in registration scenarios .</li>
      <li>Support for Call Forwarding and VoiceMail scenarios. See new scenarios sut_fwd_A.xml, sut_fwd_B.xml and sut_fwd_C.xml</li>
      <li>Support for UDP Keep-Alive. See <a href="reference.html#KeepAlive">Keep Alive</a></li> 
      <li>Support for generating load to multiple SUT by setting &lt;multiple_sut&gt; parameter to 1 within the configuration section of manager.xml;</li>
      <li>Support gcc-4.4 C++ stdlib changes, which changes the prototypes for many of the str*() family of functions.</li>

      <li>(Fix) Changed the way sipp react to 4xx messages in reply to INVITES. Content of ACK message is now based on the INVITE content, not hard-coded anymore.
</li>
      <li>(Fix) Fixed a race condition in CManager:CheckTimeEvents which could in rare cases cause some statistics to be be incorrectly set to 0.</li>
      <li>(Fix) Fixed a segmentation fault when the last run of a bench is a run with a max_calls condition, and the manager is not run in full automated mode (-e switch)</li>
      <li>(Fix) Increased maximum number of RTD from 5 to 20 </li>
      <li>(Fix) The test was stopped when no scenario was <i>completed</i> in the step, with a message "no scenario <i>attempted</i> in this step". The test is now stopped only if the number of attempted scenario in the step is zero. A test with attempted scenario but no successfull ones in a step would not stop for this reason (if there are failed ones, it would stop because of over-ihs). This helps with tests with small steps and very long scenarios (long call duractions for instance).
</li> </ul>

      <p><b>New features and Fixes in SVN revision 589 (4-Aug-2009):</b></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Increased system limits (e.g. number of SIPP test systems)</li>
      <li>Cleaned up lots of warning related to const char*. Also made parts of manager code more readable.</li>
      <li>(Fix) Fixed max_calls condition when used in other run than first one or in multiple runs</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>New features in SVN revision 587 (28-Jul-2009):</b></p>
      <ul>
       <li>Support for SIP traffic over TCP. SIP traffic between each SIPp
       instance and the System Under Test goes over a pair of TCP sockets.</li>
       <li>Support in the <i>ims_bench</i> Perl script, for scenarios without
       pre-registration. The script can now generate user data files suitable
       for tests without a pre-registration phase (e.g. for Application Server
       testing).</li>
      </ul>
