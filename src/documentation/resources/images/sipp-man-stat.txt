  The  -trace_stat option dumps all statistics in the
  <scenario_name.csv> file. The dump starts with one header
  line with all counters. All following lines are 'snapshots' of 
  statistics counter given the statistics report frequency
  (-fd option). This file can be easily imported in any
  spreadsheet application, like Excel.

  In counter names, (P) means 'Periodic' - since last
  statistic row and (C) means 'Cumulated' - since sipp was
  started.

  Available statistics are:

  - StartTime: 
    Date and time when the test has started.

  - LastResetTime:
    Date and time when periodic counters where last reseted.

  - CurrentTime:
    Date and time of the statistic row.

  - ElapsedTime:
    Elapsed time.

  - CallRate:
    Call rate (calls per seconds).

  - IncomingCall:
    Number of incoming calls.

  - OutgoingCall:
    Number of outgoing calls.

  - TotalCallCreated:
    Number of calls created.

  - CurrentCall:
    Number of calls currently ongoing.

  - SuccessfulCall:
    Number of successful calls.

  - FailedCall:
    Number of failed calls (all reasons).

  - FailedCannotSendMessage:
    Number of failed calls because Sipp cannot send the
    message (transport issue).

  - FailedMaxUDPRetrans:
    Number of failed calls because the maximum number of
    UDP retransmission attempts has been reached.

  - FailedUnexpectedMessage:
    Number of failed calls because the SIP message received
    cannot be associated to an existing call.

  - FailedCallRejected:
    Number of failed calls because of Sipp internal error.
    (a scenario sync command is not recognized or a scenario
    action failed or a scenario variable assignment failed).

  - FailedCmdNotSent:
    Number of failed calls because of inter-Sipp
    communication error (a scenario sync command failed to
    be sent).

  - FailedRegexpDoesntMatch:
    Number of failed calls because of regexp that doesn't
    match (there might be several regexp that don't match
    during the call but the counter is increased only by
    one).

  - FailedRegexpHdrNotFound:
    Number of failed calls because of regexp with hdr    
    option but no matching header found.
